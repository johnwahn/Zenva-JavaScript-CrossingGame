# Summary 
A simple object orient program game to help visualize and learn syntax in JavaScript. The goal of the game is to let the main character, the yellow bird, reach the treasure chest while avoiding the randomly moving crabs that are on the way by moving the character with the basic arrow keys where the character can move up, down, left, and right.

# Implementations
- used HTML 2d canvas, sprites, and context in order fill in the objects (the bird, treasure, and the crabs) in the frame
- implemented the onKeyUp and onKeyDown functions in order to move the object using the arrow keys
- implemented the "step" function in order to call on the draw and update function to update the frame based on user input
- spawned the crabs at random x and y coordiantes using getRandomInt
